A restaurant? You want the best food with minimal cost.
A locality? You want a posh area devoid of certain issues.


**Placate the implacable!**  

Target the people who have shown a negative disposition on your product and potentially change them into positive reviews.


**Find and compare similar people/softwares from the same domain!**
